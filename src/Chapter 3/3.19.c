(Sales Commission Calculator) One large chemical company pays its salespeople on a commission
basis. The salespeople receive $200 per week plus 9% of their gross sales for that week. For
example, a salesperson who sells $5000 worth of chemicals in a week receives $200 plus 9% of
$5000, or a total of $650. Develop a program that will input each salespersonâ€™s gross sales for last
week and will calculate and display that salesperson's earnings. Process one salesperson's figures at a
time. Here is a sample input/output dialog:

Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 5000.00
Salary is: $650.00

Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1234.56
Salary is: $311.11

Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): 1088.89
Salary is: $298.00

Enter sales in dollars (-1 to end): -1

    printf("Salary is: %.2f\n", 200.00 + ( Sales * 0.09 ) );

  if(FlagVar == 0) printf("%s","\a\nGood Bye!\a\n");

  return 0;
